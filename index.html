<h5>ABSTRACT</h5>

<p style="font-family: Iridium LT W02 Italic; font-size: 1.5rem; letter-spacing: 0;">In 1929, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president of the newly established Republic of Turkiye, implemented the Alphabet reform. The
  reform aimed to modernize the Turkish language and promote literacy by replacing the Arabic-based Ottoman script with the Latin script.
  The Alphabet reform was part of several other reforms that were conducted at that time. Also known as the "Language Revolution", was a
  major cultural and political change. It also encouraged romanization in the language, calendar, and metric system. Today, the Latin-based
  Turkish alphabet is used throughout Turkiye and has become an important symbol of the country's modernization and secularization. In my
  essay, I will focus on the difference between the two writing systems and what got lost throughout the process. I’m using the Alphabet
  reform as a framework to understand what happened with an important craft Islamic calligraphy and printing, during the Ottoman past.
  How the reform forced to find new ways to create new art forms. I am curious how I can contribute to new approaches, by reconnecting
  to Turkish and Islamic heritage. How can I reconnect with the traditions in Arabic calligraphy and typography, before the reform in
  Turkiye, and how can we reimagine the art of abjad numerals today?

<h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>

<p>While wandering through an antique market in Istanbul, in Bomonti, I came across these two sheets of stamp collections. What made these
  stamps particularly intriguing for me is that, despite both being from the same country and century, they have completely diverse graphic
  styles. They are representing Turkiye in the 20th century. This significant difference is especially visible in typography, Where two
  separate writing systems have been used to display the Turkish language. The cause of this separation happened on 1 November 1929,
  during the Alphabet reform encouraged by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. This remembered me of my grandpa, who was born in 1928 in Turkiye and
  was part of the first generation ‘Cumhuriyet çocukları’ or ‘children of the Republic’. He went through the Alphabet reform as a peasant
  at a young age. My mom explained that he used to talk about his experiences and how it affected him and his surroundings, but sadly my
  mom doesn’t remember much anymore. My curiosity about stamps started with my grandpa. He used to collect stamps and was a philatelist.
  He left a book behind filled with stamps that he gathered himself, but also got many gifted from his friends. It’s a collective
  collection that he created. The stamp collection was like a precious piece of history that my grandpa carefully curated and treasured.
  The objects that he left with us are a beautiful way to remember him and traces of memories to learn. These objects can provide a unique
  insight into the beliefs, values, and experiences of people in the past.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-1" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> <span class="margin-note" id="fn-1" value="1">1. He ordered the pages by countries and by time.
    The last 2 pages are a mix with many different countries as Haiti, Indonesia, Suriname and even Jugoslav. My mom told me, that he would carefully dip the envelopes, letters or postcards into water, so the stamp would loosen up
    easily and be removed. He would carefully damp the stamps with a cloth and add it to his collection. After that stage he would admire them for hours looking through the pages. Sadly I found this collection in the attic when he
    already passed away. I would have loved to hear stories from his side about the stamps and about his fascination and passion. He was in his late stage of his dementia when I was young, so I didn't had the chance to really know him,
    nor did he know who I was unless we told him. Still I loved him, he was a great man. These past years I found out that we have a lot in common in the things we like. I think my fascination comes more from a curiosity, to get to know
    someone who isn't there anymore.<span class="footnotereverse"><a href="#fnref-1">↩</a></span></span>
  The objects can be seen as a tangible link to the past and a way to learn from the experiences of those who came before us, a way for
  me to reconnect with my heritage.</p>
<p>Ottoman language and Arabic script may have gone, but for me as a Muslim practicing Islam, Arabic is ingrained in my daily life, from
  prayers to reading texts, to reading the Quran. I only understand Arabic from an Islamic perspective, which I have been memorizing prayers
  and verses since a young age. Being this visible in my life, the letters were always a stranger to me, but the elegance and delicateness
  of the script have mesmerized me. I have been curious about the cultural aspect and artistic practices of the letters. It was all very
  unknown to me, until in recent years my interest grew. In my previous projects my attempt to reconnect with my heritage was by learning
  a calligraphic script ‘Thuluth’. Another aim was to learn reading and writing in Ottoman, to understand the poetic literature
  ‘Divan edebiyatı’, which was literature based on divine poetry.</p>
<p>Different understandings encourages viewing tradition as a living and dynamic entity that can inspire us to create something new, rather
  than as a fixed and unchanging set of values that limit our behavior. The reform caused a break from tradition and religion, to enter
  modernist and secular era. It created a barrier between the past and the future and encouraged (forced) people to change. With this in
  mind, facing the past, how can I use the barrier as an opportunity to reimagine traditions in calligraphy and typography today? How can
  I contribute by gaining knowledge from the past to make changes in this time? I’m interested in how people found new approaches to create
  traditional practices. Explore how I can make it meaningful and relevant to the present. I want to delve into the past, to see what was
  created, and compare it to the present.</p>
<p>It was a huge new episode for Turkiye, that forced to change and forced a shift in identity. This was a turning point to search for new
  ways to reimagine a new identity, by learning from a traditional approach. This essay will explore the Alphabet Reform of 1929 and what
  happened during that time. I will only focus on several short histories, with the Alphabet reform as the framework. My approach will
  mainly be analyzing the writing systems, from there focusing on the art and design history. Understanding what the motivations were,
  what it brought to a reform, and understanding how much was changed and what got lost in the process, through focusing on a lost art
  Abjad numerals, which was a system to convey meaning with numerals. Further, I will explore how this reform affected Arabic calligraphy,
  which was a highly regarded profession in the past and lost value through the reform. I will also include a very brief history of printing
  during the Ottoman Empire and the contribution to Arabic type, and how this shifted to Latin. To conclude I will discuss what kind of
  approach I want to take with this knowledge in my future practice.</p>

<h5>ALPHABET REFORM</h5>
<p>In 1922 The Ottoman empire, Devlet-i ʿAlīye-i ʿOsmānīye, came to an end. It reigned for more than 600 years in the Anatolian region extending
  from Vienna to Yemen. It was a Sunni Islamic state and Sharia law formed its fundamental legal system. After the Turkish independence war in
  1919-22, the parliament officially abolished the sultanate. Turkiye became the Republic of Turkey by referred as ‘the founding father’ and
  first president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Atatürk created a single-party regime ‘The people’s Republican Party’, still known to this day as CHP.
  He instigated a series of revolutions during his regime in order to raise Turkiye to the level of a ‘modern civilization’, by reshaping the
  country. The purpose was to redesign the Islamic Ottoman state and enter into a new secularist era. Before handing the empire over to the
  republic, Turkiye has experienced many modernization attempts and efforts since the 16th century, but none of them were revolutionary as
  Atatürk’s reforms.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-2" href="#fn-2">2</a></sup> <span class="margin-note" id="fn-2" value="2">2. <b>Akyol, Mustafa.</b>

<p>On 1 November 1928, it was proudly announced in the newspapers of Cumhuriyet and Vakit, that from that day Turkiye is going to use the Latin
  script for the Turkish language. The headline is saying “It is a day of success that dazzles us, this new horizon, so that in a few years the
  need of this nation will be fully satisfied, With a change that has not been addressed for centuries.” The adoption of the Latin script, which
  had already become the dominant script in Europe, facilitated greater interaction and communication with the Western world and helped to establish
  Turkiye as a secular and modern nation-state. The main purpose was to fight against high illiteracy, to ‘purify’ and improve the Turkish language,
  and to enable more affordable and convenient printing in Turkiye. More accessibility to the general population needed to be created. With the reform
  the republic tried to adapt with the new writing system, by Romanizing the press, educational books, literature, newspapers, military, banks,
  government offices, institutions, political associations, magazines, advertisements, signs, film subtitles, laws, printed matter etc. All had to
  adapt to the Latin before the deadline, in 1930 the whole country was Romanized.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-3" href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> <span class="margin-note" id="fn-3" value="3">3. <b>Yilmaz, Hale.</b> “Learning To Read (Again): The

<p>Atatürk’s ideology came from secularist and nationalist movements, his policies and theories became known as Kemalism. He created Turkish nationalism
  to ‘purify’ Turkish, extracting the Ottoman, which was influenced by Persian and Arabic, from the language and culture. His aim was to modernize and
  latinize the country, by creating a nationalistic and authoritative state through cultural domination and language. Turkiye is known for being the
  bridge between the east and west, geographically and culturally.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-4" href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> <span class="margin-note"

  Turkiye and its Ottoman past and including it in the ‘enlightened’ western culture, he could diminish the confusion between Turks and Arabs. The
  misconception between the two cultures existed for centuries. While Turks and Arabs share some cultural and historical ties, they are two distinct
  ethnic groups with unique histories, languages, and cultures.</p>

  <p>As part of a broader initiative to promote literacy and teach citizens the new Turkish letters, Millet mekteplerı, or the Nation's schools, were utilized
    as symbols during the transition from Ottoman to modern Turkish. There is archival evidence that people still continued to write or take notes in Arabic
    script. From archives, Hale Yılmaz observed the reaction of Turkish citizens and saw how they coped with change in their daily lives. She explains, ”While
    some of these responses were likely ideologically oriented and should be seen as “everyday forms of resistance,”<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-5" href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> <span class="margin-note" id="fn-5" value="5">5. <b>Yilmaz, Hale.</b>

      many were simply copying mechanisms created to deal with social change on an individual level.” Especially the older generation, that was from the Ottoman era,
      had difficulty with adapting. For the people that were already familiar with Latin script, because they had French classes or traveled to Europe regularly,
      was way easier for them to learn. Furthermore, the children that grew up with the letters had no issue with adapting to the new alphabet, but it took some generations
      before the new letters became the norm.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-6" href="#fn-6">6</a></sup> <span class="margin-note" id="fn-6" value="6">6. Ibid., p. 689.<span class="footnotereverse"><a href="#fnref-6">↩</a></span></span>
    Simultaneously the adhan and the Quran were translated from Arabic to Turkish.

    and the Quran was read in Turkish in mosques. This created an understanding of what the adhan and Quran conveyed, but this also implied a loss in meaning from its origin. During the reform, this
    particular act caused the most controversy.<sup class="footnote"><a id="fnref-8" href="#fn-8">8</a></sup> <span class="margin-note" id="fn-8" value="8">8. <b>Slavs and Tatars.</b> Naughty Nasals.

<h5>A JOURNEY TOWARDS LATINIZATION</h5>
<p>For years writing systems have been a tool to form civilizations, which evolved through humans to represent languages. Among the Turkic languages, the
  Turkish language is the major branch within the Altaic language group. It is spread all over Europe and Asia, spoken by the Azeri, the Tatars, the Turkmen,
  the Kirgiz, the Kazakh, and other dialects. The oldest discovered form of Turkish was written in Orkhon script between the 8th to 10th centuries. The
  famous French novel ‘The Little Prince’ by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry,  has over 446 translations, in effort to preserve endangered languages. For that
  reason there is a translation in modern Turkish, but also in various Turkish dialects, into Orkhon script, Ottoman, Laz language (spoken in Trabzon,
  northern Turkiye), and in Çita Mapaskiri (another form of Laz language).</p>
